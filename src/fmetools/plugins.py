        - :meth:`receive_feature` or :meth:`receive_feature_from` to process each input feature.
        - :meth:`finish` to delete any temporary files or close any connections.

        This class overrides :meth:`has_support_for` to return ``True`` for Bulk Mode support.

        Output a feature with conventional attributes that represent rejection.

        Method will first attempt to output to ``<Rejected>``. If the ``<Rejected>`` tag doesn't exist on the
        ``PythonFactory`` definition, then feature will be directed to ``PYOUTPUT``.

        For transformers that only support FME 2024.0+, the transformer definition file should:

        * Specify a ``PY_OUTPUT_TAGS`` clause in the ``PythonFactory`` definition
        * Add ``<Rejected>`` to ``OUTPUT_TAGS`` and ``PY_OUTPUT_TAGS``
        * Specify ``<Rejected>`` output tag in the ``PythonFactory`` definition

        Example of a ``PythonFactory`` definition for a transformer with two output ports::

            FACTORY_DEF {*} PythonFactory
                FACTORY_NAME { $(XFORMER_NAME) }
                $(INPUT_LINES)
                SYMBOL_NAME { symbol_name }
                PY_OUTPUT_TAGS { Output <Rejected> }
                OUTPUT { Output FEATURE_TYPE $(OUTPUT_Output_FTYPE)
                    $(OUTPUT_Output_FUNCS) }
                OUTPUT { <Rejected> FEATURE_TYPE $(OUTPUT_<Rejected>_FTYPE)
                    $(OUTPUT_<Rejected>_FUNCS) }

        To support versions earlier than FME 2024.0, the transformer definition file needs to specify a
        ``<Rejected>`` output port, and its Execution Instructions need some corresponding lines:

        * A ``TestFactory`` definition that sends features with
          the ``fme_rejection_code`` attribute to the rejection port.
        * Handling for the possibility of the transformer's initiator/input feature
          coming in with ``fme_rejection_code`` already defined.
          The transformer should not send features to the rejection port unless
          the feature was actually rejected by the transformer.
          If the input feature included rejection attributes,
          the transformer should pass them through in its output features.
          If the transformer happens to reject such a feature,
          it's free to overwrite those existing attributes.

        Example of a ``PythonFactory`` and ``TestFactory`` definition for a transformer with two output ports::

            FACTORY_DEF {*} PythonFactory

            # and emit to the correct output port based on value of fme_rejection_code.

                FACTORY_NAME { $(XFORMER_NAME)_ROUTER }
                INPUT { FEATURE_TYPE $(XFORMER_NAME)_PROCESSED }
