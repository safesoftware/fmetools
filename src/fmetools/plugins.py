        .. versionadded:: 2022.0
            This method and its corresponding constants in :mod:`fmeobjects`.

        This method is used by FME to check whether the transformer claims support for certain capabilities.
        Currently, the only supported type is :data:`fmeobjects.FME_SUPPORT_FEATURE_TABLE_SHIM`,
        which determines support for Bulk Mode.

        **Why support Bulk Mode**

        When a transformer supports Bulk Mode,
        FME may pass features to :meth:`input` that come from a feature table object.
        This allows significant performance gains when processing many features,
        but requires the transformer to follow certain rules around how it handles features.

        .. seealso:: `How FME Improves Performance with Bulk Mode <https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Form/Workbench/Improving-Performance-Bulk-Mode.htm>`_.

        **How to support Bulk Mode**

        * Features received by :meth:`input` must not be copied or cached for later use.
        * Features received by :meth:`input` must not be read or modified after being passed to :meth:`pyoutput`.
        * :meth:`pyoutput` should not be given new :class:`FMEFeature` instances.
          Doing so will automatically downgrade feature processing to individual mode.
        * Override this method. When ``support_type`` is :data:`fmeobjects.FME_SUPPORT_FEATURE_TABLE_SHIM`,
          return ``True``.

        Violating these requirements may result in undefined behavior.

        **Illegal Examples**

        *Copy and access later:* ::

            def input(self, feature):
                self._cached_features.append(feature)

            def close(self):
                for feature in self._cached_features:  # not allowed
                    self.pyoutput(feature)

        *Access after output:* ::

            def input(self, feature):
                self.pyoutput(feature)
                feature.setAttribute("attr name", "attr val")  # not allowed

        *Group-by processing:* ::

            def input(self, feature):
                self._cached_features.append(feature)

            def process_group(self):

            Currently, the only supported type is :data:`fmeobjects.FME_SUPPORT_FEATURE_TABLE_SHIM`.

        Output a feature with conventional attributes that represent rejection.

        To work as intended, the transformer definition file needs to specify a ``<REJECTED>`` output port,
        and its Execution Instructions needs some corresponding lines:

        * A ``TestFactory`` definition that sends features with
          the ``fme_rejection_code`` attribute to the rejection port.
        * Handling for the possibility of the transformer's initiator/input feature
          coming in with ``fme_rejection_code`` already defined.
          The transformer should not send features to the rejection port unless
          the feature was actually rejected by the transformer.
          If the input feature included rejection attributes,
          the transformer should pass them through in its output features.
          If the transformer happens to reject such a feature,
          it's free to overwrite those existing attributes.
