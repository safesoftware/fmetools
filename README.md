# fmext: helpers for FME Python

_fmext_ is a Python library containing functions and classes for use with
Safe Software'S FME. It streamlines the development of Python-based
formats and transformers that can be shared as FME Packages on FME Hub.

_fmext_ is built on top of the
[Python `fmeobjects` API](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/fmepython/index.html)
that's included with FME.

_fmext_ is designed to be vendorized into your FME Python Package.
