# fmetools: helpers for FME Python

_fmetools_ is a Python library containing functions and classes for use with
Safe Software's FME. It streamlines the development of Python-based
formats and transformers that can be shared as FME Packages on FME Hub.

_fmetools_ is built on top of the
[Python `fmeobjects` API](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/fmepython/index.html)
that's included with FME.

_fmetools_ is designed to be vendorized into your FME Python Package.
